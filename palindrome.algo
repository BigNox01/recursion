BEGIN
    read(word)
    // the process
    2 counters : i,j
    i: counter for the beginning of the word
    j: for the end of the word
    i advances with (i+1)
    j retreats with (j-1)
    until i+1=j-1
    if the words until i+1=j-1 are the same then that word is a palindrome
    // the stop case
    either an empty word or it composes of a single character
